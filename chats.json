      "Hi! How can I help with algorithms today? I can explain concepts, walk through problems, and provide runnable code. Here are some common starting points (tell me which you want or name something else):\n\n- Sorting: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Tim Sort, and when to use each.\n- Searching: Binary Search, linear vs. binary search trees, hashing basics.\n- Graphs: BFS/DFS, Dijkstra\u2019s, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, A*.\n- Dynamic Programming: Longest Common Subsequence, Knapsack, Matrix Chain Multiplication, TSP basics.\n- Greedy: Huffman coding, Activity Selection, MST (Prim/Kruskal).\n- Divide and Conquer: Master theorem intuition, FFT basics.\n- Backtracking: N-Queens, Sudoku solving, permutations/combinations.\n- Complexity: Time and space analysis (Big O/\u03a9/\u0398), optimization trade-offs.\n- Problem solving: Step-by-step approach to a specific problem, with Python/C++/Java code.\n\nIf you want, I can start with a quick example, like implementing binary search in Python and analyzing its complexity, or walk through a DP problem with a concrete example. What would you like to dive into?",

      "Sure. Here\u2019s a minimal Tkinter app that opens a window with a label and a button that increments a counter.\n\nCode (save as app.py):\n\nimport tkinter as tk\n\ndef main():\n    root = tk.Tk()\n    root.title(\"Counter App\")\n\n    count = tk.IntVar(value=0)\n\n    label = tk.Label(root, text=f\"Count: {count.get()}\", font=(\"Arial\", 14))\n    label.pack(padx=20, pady=10)\n\n    def on_click():\n        count.set(count.get() + 1)\n        label.config(text=f\"Count: {count.get()}\")\n\n    btn = tk.Button(root, text=\"Increment\", command=on_click)\n    btn.pack(padx=20, pady=10)\n\n    root.mainloop()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nHow to run:\n- Save as app.py\n- Run: python app.py (or python3 app.py)\n\nNotes:\n- Tkinter is in the Python standard library (often available as tkinter or Tkinter).\n- If you\u2019re on Linux and GUI isn\u2019t available, you may need to install python3-tk.",
